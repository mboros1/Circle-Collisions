# Circle-Collisions
This is a basic case collision detection program written for the windows console, taking typed inputs from the user. 
It takes two fixed radius discs, starting with an initial velocity of 0 and a fixed acceleration, and moving in 2, 3,
 or more spatial dimensions. The program detects whether the discs will collide, and if so what time the collision occurs
 and the coordinates where the collision happens.
